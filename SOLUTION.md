# 🚀 SOLUTION: How to Run Your Android App

## ⚠️ The Problem
Windows is locking the `R.jar` file during builds, making command-line builds unreliable.

**Root Cause**: Multiple Java processes (VS Code Java Language Server, Android Studio, Gradle daemons) can hold file locks on Windows, preventing Gradle from cleaning or rebuilding.

## ✅ **RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: Use Android Studio**

This is the **easiest and most reliable** way to build and run your Android app on Windows:

### Steps:

1. **Close ALL these applications** (important!):
   - VS Code (yes, close it completely)
   - Any Android Studio instances
   - IntelliJ IDEA (if running)

2. **Open Android Studio**
   - Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Or launch if already installed

3. **Open Your Project**
   - File → Open
   - Navigate to: `F:\kotlin\chatty`
   - Click OK

4. **Wait for Gradle Sync**
   - Android Studio will sync automatically
   - Wait for "Gradle sync finished" message (1-2 minutes)
   - If you see errors about configuration cache, ignore them (we already disabled it)

5. **Create an Emulator** (if you don't have one):
   - Tools → Device Manager
   - Click "Create Device"
   - Choose: Pixel 5
   - System Image: API 33 (Tiramisu)
   - Click Finish

6. **Run the App**
   - Click the green ▶️ Run button (top toolbar)
   - Or press `Shift + F10`
   - Select your emulator
   - Wait for app to launch (~30 seconds first time)

7. **Success!** 🎉
   - You'll see the login screen
   - Try logging in (it's mocked for now, any credentials work)
   - Explore the chat list and chat room screens

## 🔧 Alternative: Command Line (If You Must)

If you absolutely need to use command line:

### Option A: Run the unlock script
```powershell
.\unlock-and-build.ps1
```

This script will:
- Stop all Gradle daemons
- Kill all Java processes
- Force delete the build directory
- Build with `--no-daemon` flag

### Option B: Manual steps
```powershell
# 1. Close VS Code and Android Studio COMPLETELY

# 2. Stop all Java processes
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -match "java|gradle"} | Stop-Process -Force

# 3. Wait a bit
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5

# 4. Delete build directory (using cmd for better file deletion)
cmd /c "rd /s /q androidApp\build"

# 5. Build with no daemon
.\gradlew.bat :androidApp:assembleDebug --no-daemon --no-configuration-cache

# 6. Install to device
adb install androidApp\build\outputs\apk\debug\androidApp-debug.apk
```

### Option C: Restart Your Computer
If all else fails:
1. Save your work
2. Restart Windows
3. Don't open VS Code or Android Studio
4. Run: `.\gradlew.bat :androidApp:assembleDebug --no-daemon`

## 🎯 Why Android Studio is Better

| Command Line | Android Studio |
|-------------|----------------|
| ❌ File locks from other processes | ✅ Handles all file management |
| ❌ Need to manually manage emulators | ✅ Built-in Device Manager |
| ❌ Manual APK installation | ✅ One-click run |
| ❌ No visual debugger | ✅ Full debugging tools |
| ❌ Manual log viewing | ✅ Integrated Logcat |
| ❌ Windows compatibility issues | ✅ Optimized for Windows |

## 📱 What You'll See

Once the app runs, you'll see:

1. **Login Screen**
   - Beautiful Material 3 design
   - Login and Register tabs
   - Input validation

2. **Chat List Screen**
   - List of chat rooms (empty for now)
   - FloatingActionButton to create new chats
   - Pull-to-refresh

3. **Chat Room Screen**
   - Message bubbles (your messages vs others)
   - Timestamp formatting
   - Message input bar
   - Auto-scroll to latest message

## 🐛 Current State

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Complete UI with 3 screens
- ✅ Navigation between screens
- ✅ ViewModels with state management
- ✅ Dependency injection (Koin)
- ✅ Material 3 theming

**What's Mocked:**
- 🔄 Chat list (returns empty list)
- 🔄 Chat room messages (mocked data)
- 🔄 User authentication (any credentials work)

**What's Next:**
- Complete ChatRoomRepository
- Complete UserRepository
- Connect to real backend
- Implement actual WebSocket messaging

## 💡 Pro Tip

**Always use Android Studio for Android development on Windows!**

The command line is great for CI/CD and Linux, but on Windows, Android Studio provides the most reliable development experience. It handles all the quirks of Windows file locking, process management, and Android SDK configuration.

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If Android Studio also fails:

1. **Check Android SDK**: Make sure it's installed at:
   ```
   C:\Users\boure_rr1habg\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
   ```

2. **Check Java**: Android Studio uses its bundled JDK at:
   ```
   C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio3\jbr
   ```

3. **Update Gradle**: If sync fails, let Android Studio update Gradle wrapper

4. **Invalidate Caches**: In Android Studio:
   - File → Invalidate Caches
   - Check all boxes
   - Click "Invalidate and Restart"

---

**TL;DR**: Close everything, open Android Studio, open project, click Run. Done! 🚀
