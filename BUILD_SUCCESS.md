## 🚀 Next Steps - Choose Your Path

### Option 1: Create a Simple Desktop App (Recommended - 30 minutes)
**Why**: See your work come to life with a visual interface

```powershell
# I'll create a minimal desktop app with:
# - Login screen
# - Chat list view  
# - Basic UI components
```

**What you'll get**:
- A window you can run and see
- Working Compose UI
- Something tangible to show off!

---

### Option 2: Build the Ktor Server (1 hour)
**Why**: Set up the backend so frontend can connect

```powershell
# I'll create the server with:
# - WebSocket endpoint for real-time chat
# - REST API for authentication
# - In-memory message storage (for now)
```

**What you'll get**:
- Running server on localhost:8080
- WebSocket echo server for testing
- REST endpoints ready for client

---

### Option 3: Create UI Screens with Mock Data (2 hours)
**Why**: Build out the full UI experience

**What I'll create**:
- Login/Register screens
- Chat list with mock conversations
- Chat room with message history
- Message input component
- Navigation between screens

**What you'll get**:
- Complete UI flow
- Interactive mockup
- Ready for backend integration

---

### Option 4: Complete the Missing Repositories (1 hour)
**Why**: Finish the data layer foundation

**What I'll implement**:
- `ChatRoomRepositoryImpl` - Create/join rooms, manage participants
- `UserRepositoryImpl` - Search users, update status

**What you'll get**:
- 100% complete data layer
- All use cases functional
- Ready for UI integration
