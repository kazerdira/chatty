## Step 1: Open PowerShell (1 minute)

1. Press `Windows + X`
2. Click "Windows PowerShell" or "Terminal"
3. Navigate to your project:
   ```powershell
   cd f:\kotlin\chatty
   ```

---

## Step 2: Check Java (1 minute)

Run this command:
```powershell
java -version
```

**What should happen:**
- ✅ Shows version 17 or higher → **GOOD! Continue to Step 3**
- ❌ Shows version 11 or lower → **Need to install JDK 17**
- ❌ Command not found → **Need to install JDK**

**If you need JDK:**
1. Download: <https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17>
2. Install it
3. Restart PowerShell
4. Try `java -version` again

---

## Step 3: First Build! (3-5 minutes)

This will download everything and compile the code.

Run this command:
```powershell
.\gradlew build
```

**What will happen:**
1. Gradle downloads (~100 MB) - be patient!
2. Dependencies download (~200 MB) - first time only
3. Code compiles
4. Tests run

**Expected result:**
```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2m 30s
```

✅ **If you see "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"** → **AWESOME! Go to Step 4!**

❌ **If you see errors** → **Tell me the error and I'll fix it!**

---

## Step 4: Run Your First Test! (1 minute)

We created some tests. Let's run them!

```powershell
.\gradlew :shared:test
```

**Expected result:**
```
> Task :shared:allTests
UserTest > test user creation PASSED
UserTest > test user status enum PASSED
MessageTest > test text message creation PASSED

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```

✅ **Tests pass?** → **YOU'RE A ROCKSTAR! 🎸**

---

## Step 5: Celebrate! 🎉

**YOU DID IT!** Your project:
- ✅ Compiles successfully
- ✅ Tests pass
- ✅ Everything works!
